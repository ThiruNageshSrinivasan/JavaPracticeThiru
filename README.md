This mini project demonstrates the core behavior of essential Java keywords through simple, well-structured examples:
- final: Restricts modification (variables), inheritance (classes), or overriding (methods)
- this: Refers to the current object instance and resolves naming conflicts
- static: Belongs to the class, shared across all instances
- Non-static: Instance-level data and behavior, unique per object
Perfect for beginners looking to understand Java fundamentals through clean code and practical use cases.
